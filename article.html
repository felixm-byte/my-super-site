			<p>As a web developer with a passion for indie games, I was excited to use my technical skills to create a website that showcases the best and most interesting titles out there. But when I heard about ChatGPT, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, I was intrigued. I decided to use it as an experiment to generate the code for my website, and it turned out to be a great decision.</p>

			<p>To get started, I inputted a prompt like "Please create a website showcasing my indie game portfolio. It should have a large hero page and an orange accent colour." ChatGPT then generated the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for my website based on that prompt.</p>

			<p>The generated code was quite impressive, but it wasn't perfect. As a web developer, I had the technical knowledge to make modifications and tweaks to the code to suit my needs. I made some changes to the layout and styling, and I added some additional interactive features to the website.</p>

			<p>Once I had the code in place, I hosted my website on GitHub Pages, a free hosting service that's perfect for static sites like mine. The website turned out great, and I'm really happy with how it looks and functions.</p>

			<p>Using ChatGPT to create my website was a fascinating experiment, and it really opened my eyes to the possibilities of AI and natural language processing. I'm excited to see what other projects I can tackle using this powerful technology in the future.</p>
      
      <p>That was ChatGPT writing, and this is Felix. ChatGPT is (as we all know) very helpful and it wrote all of the code in this website. It took a few attempts to get it to actually make a website but, as you can see, when it works it works great. Check out the code at the github, which I'll add here soon.</p>
